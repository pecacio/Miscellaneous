https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem
It is the problem of finding a stable matchong between two equally sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences of each element.
A matching is a bijection from elements from one set to the elements of the other.
A matching is not stable if:
1. There is an element A of the first matched set whuch prefers some element B of the second matched set over the element already matched to A.
2. B also prefers the element A over the element already matched to B
In other words a matching is stable when there does not exist any match (A,B) whch both prefer each other over their current partners.

Example:
A1,A2,A3,A4 be the males and B1,B2,B3,B4 be the females
